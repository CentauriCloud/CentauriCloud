# Contributing to Centauri Cloud

We're happy about everybody looking forward to help contributing to our project. If you submit your Pull Request, we'll try to review it as soon as possible. To make the reviewing process faster and less stressful for everyone, please follow our Contribution guide.

## Submitting Pull Requests
- *Create speaking commit names* - We want to understand what you did in your code
- *Squashing and Rebasing is forbidden*
- *Document complicated things* - If you're doing some more advanced work, document it.
- *Tell us what you fixed* - If you're trying to fix an issue or implement a new feature, please refer to the corrospoing [issue](https://github.com/CentauriCloud/CentauriCloud/issues)

## Using the issue tracker
The [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/CentauriCloud/CentauriCloud/issues) is the prefered place to report bugs or suggest new features. If you wan't to create a new issue, please make sure you're following the guidelines. 

### Bug reports
- *Add the version* - Add the version, so we can replicate the bug. Maybe it was fixed in a newer version? 
- *Steps to replicate* - In order to properly debug the software, we need the steps to replicate the bug. 
- *In which module is the bug* - Since the main repository contains multiple modules with different sources, we need the exact module which is causing trouble
- *Do not use issues for personal support* - GitHub's issues are here for bug reports, not for configuration problems. If you have trouble getting your network up and running, we offer limited support in Discord. 

### Feature requests
If you want to request a new feature, feel free to do so. We'll add the proper label to your issue. Please note, that feature request must target the latest CentauriCloud version. If you're a developer, you can help to implement the new feature. 

> Note: implementation of new features may can take a while and not every request has to be accepted
